/**
 * Static guard for ruvnet/ruflo#3335 and #3390 (#3327 Finding A).
 *
 * The release train is exactly three packages — `@claude-flow/cli`,
 * `claude-flow`, `ruflo`. Four internal components ride along INSIDE those
 * tarballs (`INTERNAL_RUNTIME_PACKAGES` in stage-internal-runtime-bundles.mjs:
 * security, codex, mcp, plugin-agent-federation), so a source change in them
 * ships with the train.
 *
 * Every OTHER `@claude-flow/*` dependency of the CLI — currently cli-core,
 * neural, shared, memory — is resolved from the REGISTRY at the version
 * `v3/@claude-flow/cli/package.json` declares. A merged source change in one of
 * those does NOT ship with the train: the release silently carries the last
 * *published* copy of that leaf.
 *
 * This has now bitten twice:
 *
 *   #3335 (2026-09-16) — PR #3334 fixed RUFLO_INTELLIGENCE_MODE in
 *   @claude-flow/memory. v3.42.1 shipped cli/claude-flow/ruflo only; memory was
 *   last published 2026-08-22, so a fresh consumer install had ZERO references
 *   to the fix.
 *
 *   #3390 (2026-09-21) — the reasoningBank activation fix spanned
 *   cli/src/memory/memory-bridge.ts AND memory/src/controller-registry.ts.
 *   Publishing only the train would have shipped the bridge half and left the
 *   embedder half unreachable, leaving reasoningBank just as inert as before.
 *   Caught by hand; memory@3.0.0-alpha.25 was published alongside v3.42.5.
 *
 * The trap is that CI goes GREEN on such a change: the leaf's own package tests
 * run against workspace source, so the fix looks verified while being unshippable.
 *
 * Asserts:
 *
 *   1. For every non-bundled `@claude-flow/*` dep of the CLI that exists as a
 *      workspace package, the CLI's declared range must be satisfied by the
 *      workspace's own version. A miss means the release resolves to something
 *      OLDER than the source in this repo.
 *
 *   2. (diff mode — needs a base ref) If a leaf's publishable source changed
 *      relative to the base ref but its package.json `version` did NOT, the
 *      release cannot ship that change. Bump the leaf and publish it.
 *
 * Diff mode is skipped, loudly, when no base ref is available — "not exercised"
 * is reported distinctly from "clean" so a skip can never read as a pass.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/audit-leaf-package-publish.mjs [--base <ref>]
 *         GITHUB_BASE_REF is used automatically in PR CI.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ok / 1 violations (or the guard inspected nothing).
