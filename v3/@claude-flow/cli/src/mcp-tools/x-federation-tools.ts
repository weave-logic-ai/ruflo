/**
 * Relay-sourced gateway responses are not bare JSON. Since #3300 the gateway
 * wraps anything published by other federation members in a provenance envelope
 * (plugins/ruflo-x-gateway/src/untrusted.mjs): several lines of gateway-authored
 * prose, then the JSON body between a matched
 * `<<<UNTRUSTED_RELAY_DATA <uuid>>>>` / `<<<END_UNTRUSTED_RELAY_DATA <uuid>>>>`
 * pair. `JSON.parse` on the whole string fails on the first prose word, which is
 * the `Unexpected token 'T', "The block "...` seen from every federation read.
 *
 * Three things keep a publisher from closing the block early, and it is worth
 * being precise about which one is doing the work today:
 *   1. The body is JSON.stringify'd, so it is a SINGLE line — a publisher's text
 *      cannot contain a raw newline, and the markers below are newline-anchored.
 *      This is what actually neutralises forged markers in relay content today.
 *   2. The token backreference: a forged END carrying any other token does not
 *      terminate the region. This is the defence that survives (1) — if the body
 *      is ever pretty-printed, it becomes the only one left. It is tested
 *      directly rather than incidentally, so it cannot be refactored away quietly.
 *   3. Exactly one opening marker is permitted. `fenceUntrusted` splices its
 *      `note` verbatim BEFORE the fence, so a caller that ever interpolates
 *      relay-derived text into a note could otherwise smuggle in a complete
 *      earlier envelope; first-match-wins would return it, with untrusted:false.
 *
 * We deliberately return the WHOLE envelope (`untrusted`, `provenance`, `relay`,
 * `retrievedAt`, `data`) rather than lifting `data` out of it. The point of the
 * envelope is that a caller can tell whose words these are; quietly unwrapping to
 * the payload would restore valid JSON by discarding the labelling that made it
 * safe to read. Unfenced responses (the registry resource, gateway-authored
 * errors) parse unchanged.
